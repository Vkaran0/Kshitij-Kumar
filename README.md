## 🚀 About Me

Hello, my name is **Kshitij Kumar**. I am a passionate software developer with hands-on experience in building **industry-level and production-ready projects**.

I have worked on a successful industrial project in collaboration with **Hindalco Industries**, where I contributed to developing a **fault detection system for industrial machines**, focusing on real-time monitoring and reliability.

Alongside industrial projects, I have built multiple **fully functional web applications**, including:
- 🔹 Lost & Found Portal  
- 🔹 Ride Matching Platform  
- 🔹 Advanced Learning Management System (LMS)  

These applications were developed using the **MERN stack**, with a focus on scalability, performance, and clean UI/UX.

I am a **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 Finalist** and continuously work on improving my skills by solving real-world problems through technology.
